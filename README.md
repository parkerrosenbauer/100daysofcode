Python 100 Days of Code Challenge

I started this 100 Days of Code Challenge because, while I've used Python for many projects, I never took the time to learn the fundementals. I learned the very
basics and then just explored whatever packages I needed enough to be able to complete my project. I want to be profficient in coding with python which will help 
all of my projects down the line, as well as explore new possibilities I didn't know were available.

To complete this challenge I am following the "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022" on Udemy taught by Dr. Angela Yu from AppBrewery
