        <h1>Parker Rosenbauer</h1>
        <p><em>Data Science Bootcamp Student</em></p>
        <p>My name is Parker, I'm 24 years old, and I live in Menomonie, WI. My professional background includes
            experience in retail and property management. In order to pursue data science as a career, I am currently
            enrolled in QuickStart's Bootcamp, hosted by Northeastern Illinois University. In the Bootcamp, I not only
            have the opportunity to learn how to collect, clean, analyze, and interpret data, but I also get to work
            with a mentor who is in the field, as well as classmates who are going through similar experiences as
            myself.</p>
